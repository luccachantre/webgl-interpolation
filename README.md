# webgl-interpolation
This is a project that I completed for a computer animation class at WPI, it loads and parses a spline file with curve points and rotations at those curves, and uses catmull rom, bspline, quaternions, and slerp to animate a cube moving along the path of the spline points and performing the spline rotations
