# webgl-interpolation
This is a project that I completed for a computer animation class at WPI, it loads and parses a spline file with curve points and rotations at those curves, and uses catmull rom, bspline, quaternions, and slerp to animate a cube moving along the path of the spline points and performing the spline rotations

## running the program
simply load open the html page in a local browser, then click the select file button, and select the spline1.txt folder, and watch the animation play! It will first move the cube through the points using catmull rom, then it will use bspline. feel free to create your own spline files with modified point data to create your own animation paths and rotations!
